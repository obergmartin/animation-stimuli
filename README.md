# animation-stimuli
This code produces animations used for generating experimental stimuli using the Processing language (processing.org).  Each folder contains a different simulation environment. Different shapes can be shown by uncommenting lines in the main fille.
`side_view_world` simulates falling objects bouncing off of a floor and walls.
`top_down_view_world` simulates objects bouncing off of four walls and slowed by friction.
